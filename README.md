# Masters-Project-KR

Masters of computer science Masters project, implementing openai gyms to test various Deep RL algorithms against as baselines.
These environments are designed to have scalable action and state space complexity. i.e. we can increase the complexity of the problem while keeping the number of possible actions the same, or vice versa

Environments implemented:

- N-jointed arm
- Environment consists of an arm of N-joints which must configure itself    to touch an objective

    - Action space : discrete (scalable)
    - State space : continuous (joints + objective placement)

- Evader environment

TODO
- Traffic Lights
    - Action space : discrete (scalable)
    - State space : continuous ()


Algorithms implemented:


- Deep Q Learning

TODO
    - Recurrent Q-Learning
    - A2C
    - Double Q-Learning
